				<p>As a teacher, you need to secure a learning environment that puts value on positive behaviours that maximise the learning in the classroom. In this blog, I have listed my top tips for behaviour for learning.</p>

				<p>1.School Behaviour Policy</p>
				<p>Use this policy as it can be highly effective but it is paramount it is used consistently. It is best to avoid jumping to consequences straight away and explore other options first.</p>

				<p>2.High expectations</p>
				<p>You need to be clear about your rules. Make them simple and avoid having too many. Try to give a reason for your rule too so the pupils understand. When pupils meet your high expectations, pay them compliments and do not reward minimum standards.</p>

				<p>3.Recognition board</p>
				<p>Put names on the recognition board for learning attitudes, effort and meeting high expectations. Aim to get everyone’s name on the board to get a sense of belonging in the classroom.</p>

				<p>4.Positive relationships</p>
				<p>Most difficult behaviour issues emerge from attachment issues at home so building positive relationships with these pupils are vital. Pupils want to feel important and valued. Meet and greet at the door with a smile and show an interest in their work and them as a person.</p>

				<p>5.Emotions</p>
				<p>Your attitude and behaviour towards pupils are important. Try not to react in a negative and emotional way.</p>

				<p>6.Primary behaviours</p>
				<p>Address primary behaviours before you act on secondary behaviours.</p>

				<p>7.Take-up time</p>
				<p>Give pupils take up time to choose to respond in the right way.</p>

				<p>8.Parental involvement</p>
				<p>Contact parents and other adults and send positive praise.</p>

				<p>9.Ask for help</p>
				<p>Seek help from other colleagues who may be successful with particularly difficult pupils.</p>

				<p>10. Do your homework</p>
				<p>Get the background knowledge of pupils you are teaching.</p>

				<p>11. Confidence</p>
				<p>Present yourself as a confident teacher. Use commanding language rather than making requests.</p>

				<p>12. Non-verbal communication</p>
				<p>Body posture, eye contact and non-verbal communication are all important skills and these can be honed outside of the classroom.</p>

				<p>13. Dress code</p>
				<p>Professional dress establishes authority, can communicate responsibility and reflect an individual’s personality.</p>
