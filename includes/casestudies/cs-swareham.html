				<h4>My Background</h4>
				<p>Before getting into teaching, I studied Graphic Design at University and worked for an IT company. It became clear that an office job wasnâ€™t for me and I started to think about what I wanted to do for a career, rather than a job.</p>

				<h4>Why I wanted to teach</h4>
				<p>I wanted to become a teacher for many reasons. I wanted to challenge myself, to share my love of learning, do something meaningful with my career and to, hopefully one day, make students believe in themselves the way my school teachers did for me. </p>

				<h4>Training</h4>
				<p>The training through The Solent SCITT was fantastic. It was great to hit the ground running and get into my placement school much earlier than if I had gone through a University PGCE route.</p>
				<p>The SCITT team throughout the whole year were so supportive and encouraging and always there if I had any concerns or needed extra guidance. There were some points in my training year that were tough to get through and it was with the help of the SCITT team that I got through those.</p>

				<h4>Future aspirations</h4>
				<p>I am now working at The Weald School in Billingshurst as a Product Design teacher, teaching KS3, 4 and 5. I also teach Personal Development to year 7, run an electronics club and work with another member of staff as a co-tutor. My future aspirations are to gradually take on more responsibilities within my department over the next few years, then moving on towards one day being head of department and into senior leadership later in my career.</p>
