	        <h4>My Background</h4>
	        <p>I studied American Studies and History for three years at the University of Portsmouth. I left with a qualification of a 2:1 BA. Before I completed the degree, I realised I wanted to pursue a career in teaching History. This derived from my passion of the subject and wanting to share that enthusiasm with others. During my final year, I spent time observing different schools. From this experience, I realised I wanted to pursue this further and spent time in a secondary school as a Teaching Assistant to really gain an insight. I did this at Park Community School for an academic year. I thoroughly enjoyed this experience and it encouraged me to continue on my original career path.</p>

	        <h4>Why I wanted to teach</h4>
	        <p>I wanted to become a teacher of History due to my immense passion in my field. I enjoy my subject and wanted to share this with others. I also enjoy working with children, each day is a completely new day- it is exciting to be a part of.</p>

	        <h4>Training</h4>
	        <p>I decided to join The Solent SCITT, which was based at Park Community School, because of how welcoming and supportive I knew the school and its staff to already be from my time as a TA.</p>

	        <h4>Future aspirations</h4>
	        <p>I am an NQT now working as a Humanities teacher at Park Community School. I am thoroughly enjoying my time here. I hope to continue my time at this school in this department and progress further, contributing to the whole school.</p>
