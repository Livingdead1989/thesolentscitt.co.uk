				<h4>My Background</h4>
				<p>My degree is in Graphic Design and my previous careers involved creativity and teaching children. Training to be a qualified Primary teacher enables me to overlap and fuse these and develop my own teaching style.</p>

				<h4>Why I wanted to teach</h4>
				<p>After feeling unsatisfied in other jobs, I wanted a career which gave me a real purpose every day. Children are fantastic critics; they keep you on your toes, and the role is constantly evolving.</p>

				<h4>Training</h4>
				<p>I know that SCITT training was definitely the right approach for me; being able to apply your training to see its impact, and then reflect and adjust your planning accordingly on a day to day basis is just invaluable. Having such instant feedback really maximises your progression and boosts your skills and confidence.</p>

				<h4>Future aspirations</h4>
				<p>I am about to start applying for jobs, which will be an exciting journey. Longer term I am interested in how I can adapt my practice to use my creative skills for maximum benefit to the children.</p>
