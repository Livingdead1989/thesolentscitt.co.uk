	        <h4>My Background</h4>
	        <p>I have a BA Hons degree in Accounting and previously worked for 6 years as a financial sales representative for a global I.T infrastructure firm in London. Alongside that I am a Qualified Management accountant with a CIMA qualification.  I chose to go travelling for 10 months during which time I qualified to teach English as a foreign language and have taught in 16 countries around the world.</p>

	        <h4>Why I wanted to teach</h4>
	        <p>I wanted to be able to help students improve their quality of life and open up opportunities for their futures.</p>

	        <h4>Training</h4>
	        <p>SCITT training was an amazing experience. It was an equal amount of theory and practical to ensure that I was well rounded and had the skills to succeed in the classroom. The practical element allowed me to learn from the students to progress my skills in teaching.</p>

	        <h4>Future aspirations</h4>
	        <p>I am currently teaching Maths and completing a Masters in Teaching and Learning.  In the future I hope to progress my teaching skills to be able to implement changes that will impact students learning and school experience.  I would also like to combine my knowledge of business with my teaching career.</p>
