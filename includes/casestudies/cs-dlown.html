				<h4>My Background</h4>
				<p>I’ve spent the last 20 years in the Royal Air Force. During this time, I have been deployed on operational duty into military field hospitals as a Biomedical Scientist, focusing on blood transfusion and clinical microbiology. I obtained a BSc and MSc in Biomedical Science over this period. I chose to leave in order to remain with my family in East Hampshire</p>

				<h4>Why I wanted to teach</h4>
				<p>Seeing the look in a student’s eye when they understand, especially in Science, is an immensely gratifying feeling.</p>

				<h4>Training</h4>
				<p>Being able to train in a safe and personal environment is really good - as one of only 30 student teachers there are many opportunities for 1-to-1 if and when required. There is an excellent mix of practical and theoretical training within the course. One of the best parts is the ability to start within the school environment before the students return. This helps the process, ensuring I felt part of the teaching staff.</p>

				<h4>Future aspirations</h4>
				<p>Whilst still undertaking the SCITT course, I have accepted an NQT job at The Petersfield School starting in September 2019.  This will provide me ample opportunity to progress my teaching skills and knowledge in order to provide the very best for the students.</p>

				<h4>Quote on the training</h4>
				<p>Being able to undertake Teacher Training with The Solent SCITT offers a unique and safe environment to learn on the job.  With students from a plethora of backgrounds, The Solent SCITT provides the ideal opportunity to train in different school placements, with taught aspects of the course provided in small, close-knit groups.</p>
