				<h4>My Background</h4>
				<p>I studied CACHE childcare level 3 at college then went onto studying BA honours in Early Childhood Studies at the University of Portsmouth. I attended a wide variety of different placements within nurseries and primary schools. I was a learning support co-ordinator and LSA at a SEN secondary school supporting pupils with SEND for three years before deciding it was the time to train to become a teacher which I have always wanted to do for a long time.</p>

				<h4>Why I wanted to teach</h4>
				<p>I have always wanted to teach since I was young. I was lucky enough to have teachers who were positive role models. I had experience of teachers who always had faith in everything I did and were able to motivate me to achieve my very best. I want to be able to support pupils in finding themselves in school to prepare them for the world outside and to achieve their very best in everything they do.</p>

				<h4>Training</h4>
				<p>I knew straight away that school-based training was for me and I chose The Solent SCITT as they made me feel valued and welcomed into the school where I had my interview. The SCITT tries to match your personality and experience with a best fit placement school so you feel you are fully supported within your teacher training year. If you ever need to ask any school or training questions the SCITT team are always happy to help through every step of your journey.</p>

				<h4>Future aspirations</h4>
				<p>I am looking forward to having my own class and I feel confident that I am leaving the course with more experience and having a wider network of people around me that I have met through the course. I have gained so much confidence in everything I do through my teaching ability and picked up amazing teaching strategies along the way and I canâ€™t wait to get started.</p>
