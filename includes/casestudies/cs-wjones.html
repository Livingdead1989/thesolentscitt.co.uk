				<h4>My Background</h4>
				<p>Previously I had never worked in a role that concentrated on the development of children so this was a big career change for me. After graduating with a degree in Business Management at University, I embarked on a mainstream career path starting on a graduate management program in a sales and service industry. Throughout my time in this company, I enjoyed the coaching and development opportunities to train and upskill others and I knew that it would be something I wanted to do specifically.</p>

				<h4>Why I wanted to teach</h4>
				<p>My partner is a KS2 teacher and I have always loved hearing about the daily difference she makes to the children she has taught and the exciting challenges she faces. On numerous occasions, I considered embarking on the teaching journey but never plucked up the courage to change. During the original lockdown in May, I knew that there would never be a better time to train to become a teacher and start a career that I would love.</p>

				<h4>Training</h4>
				<p>Previously, I had only ever heard of teacher training being delivered by a University through a standard PGCE route and hadnâ€™t even considered the SCITT option. However, after speaking to former graduates of the Solent SCITT, I immediately knew that this would be the perfect option for me. The opportunity to be placed in a school from the very first day of term was brilliant as I was quickly made to feel part of the team and could experience excellent hands on training and mentoring from current experienced teachers. The SCITT team feels more like a family and it is definitely a personalized experience as the weekly training we have is led by energetic and passionate professionals that is tailored to our development.</p>

				<h4>Future aspirations</h4>
				<p>Although I am loving the training and development I have received, and spending time learning from an experience mentor, I cannot wait to get my own class in September and fully immerse myself in the teaching profession. I have gained an invaluable experience on this course and know they will continue to support me in the future</p>
