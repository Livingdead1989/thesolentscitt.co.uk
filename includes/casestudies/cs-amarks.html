				<h4>My Background</h4>
				<p>I have an undergraduate degree in American Studies with History, and I have previously worked in the Museum and Heritage sector, working at the Mary Rose Museum located in Portsmouth Historic Dockyard. As part of this role, I interacted with the local public as well as tourists from various countries who had travelled to discover the history behind Henry VIII’s most famous ship.</p>

				<h4>Why I wanted to teach</h4>
				<p>I wanted to become a teacher so that I could help students find their passion and support them achieve social and academic milestones especially those who may not receive support outside of school. My teachers from school made subjects such as History and Maths engaging even when I got things wrong or really struggled in certain subjects. This made me feel supported and that I could approach teachers with any and all questions. I hope to achieve the same approach to the next generation’s learning journey who feel they can ask and engage in topics without fear of having failed.</p>

				<h4>Training</h4>
				<p>My experience with The Solent SCITT has been incredible. Being part of the school community from day one has made me feel part of team, built my confidence, and provided plenty of opportunity to practice and develop teaching strategies that suit me. The SCITT mentors offered so much support and advice, especially during this uncertain time. I am grateful to the SCITT for going beyond expectations in helping me achieve my dream job.</p>

				<h4>Future aspirations</h4>
				<p>I am continuously learning and plan to focus on strengthening the skills I have learnt this year and ready to face new challenges. Long-term I hope to achieve a senior-leadership role that supports students find their passion for learning a new skill or career beyond secondary school.</p>
