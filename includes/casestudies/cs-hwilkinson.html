				<h4>My Background</h4>
				<p>I have taken a slightly unconventional path into teaching science. When I was at school, I had two passions – science and dance. This led me to follow both subjects through at college before applying to study Biomedical Science at university and also musical theatre at a specialist performing arts centre. I was lucky enough to receive a scholarship to a performing arts college and I have since achieved a first class honours degree in Music and Musical Theatre. I spent time working as a dancer and performing in shows, however, I couldn’t deny my love of teaching.</p>

				<h4>Why I wanted to teach</h4>
				<p>I wanted to teach to inspire the young minds of the future, I remember teachers from school who made subjects interesting and exciting and made me feel that anything is achievable, and I hope to impart that feeling among students I teach.</p>

				<h4>Training</h4>
				<p>My experience with The Solent SCITT has been fantastic. Being in school from day one has really helped to build my confidence, whilst training sessions gave me the opportunity to develop my teaching strategies. The SCITT tutors offer so much support and are always on hand with advice - nothing is ever too much trouble. I am so grateful to the SCITT for everything they have done in helping me achieve my dream job.</p>

				<h4>Future aspirations</h4>
				<p>The training I have received has enlightened me to the ways to support students with special educational needs in mainstream education. I have been constantly inspired by the resilience of these students and also how much they gain from being in a mainstream setting. This has sparked a curiosity for me to explore SEN in more detail and therefore I hope to pursue a master's in this area. But first, I want to ensure I am constantly developing and growing into a better teacher.</p>
