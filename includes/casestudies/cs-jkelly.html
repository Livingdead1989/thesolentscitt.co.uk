				<h4>My Background</h4>
				<p>I have an undergraduate degree in Exercise Science and previously worked for the NHS in a community physiotherapy team. I helped rehabilitate people with lung conditions, teaching them how to manage and overcome their day-to-day challenges. Alongside this, I help coach at two local athletics clubs, specializing in the throwing disciplines as well as strength & conditioning.</p>

				<h4>Why I wanted to teach</h4>
				<p>I am passionate about showing how exciting science is as a subject and to also inspire the young scientists of the future. Watching students have that ‘lightbulb moment’ where everything makes sense is highly rewarding and you know that you’ve made a positive impact on their lives.</p>

				<h4>Training</h4>
				<p>Having the opportunity to start my training in school at the start of the academic year has made me feel more prepared and confident in the classroom. The SCITT tutors have offered a great amount of support and guidance, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic and the affect that it has had on the schools. The team have trainee welfare as a top priority, and I am grateful for everything they have done to enable me to progress my skills in teaching.</p>

				<h4>Future aspirations</h4>
				<p>I am looking forward to getting as many pupils as possible actively engaged in science. I am also excited to have a classroom of my own – a place where I can showcase science and inspire our future scientists.</p>
