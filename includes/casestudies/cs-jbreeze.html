				<h4>My Background</h4>
				<p>I have spent the last seven years working within events, marketing and customer service and, approaching thirty, realised that I was on a career path that just didnâ€™t have the challenge or progression I really wanted in life. With qualifications in Design and Technology, Product Design, Photography, and Media Studies, I had always longed to do something creative and really use the qualifications I had worked so hard to obtain. Although daunting to start fresh, I have now found a career I can be enthusiastic and excited about each and every day.</p>

				<h4>Why I wanted to teach</h4>
				<p>It was time for me to do something truly worthwhile! I genuinely hope to inspire young people to be creative, imaginative and teach them valuable skills that they will use throughout their lives. Equally, I wanted to begin a career that would challenge me! Where every day was different, to work alongside others, get the chance to be creative myself and really throw myself into a subject I love.</p>

				<h4>Training</h4>
				<p>The SCITT team have been fantastic throughout my training experience. These are a group of teachers who truly want each and every trainee to do well on this course. The mixture of in-school training and theory lessons that they recommend mean that we get a great balance of learning on the job and additional support. The SCITT train us on both the theory and practise of teaching with varied, yet equally important topics. The team are also always there if I have any questions, worries or just need to chat about my week in school.</p>

				<h4>Future aspirations</h4>
				<p>First and foremost, I hope to successfully complete my NQT year by continuing to learn, work on my teaching style and apply all the useful techniques the SCITT have taught me to be an accomplished and supportive teacher. Having successfully received a job offer from my placement school, I will be heading up the introduction of Design Technology: Graphic Design which will be my main focus. I am really excited to get the opportunity to make the course my own and prove just how interesting and fun Graphic Design can be. Further on from that, I am looking forward to getting involved in the wider school community.</p>
