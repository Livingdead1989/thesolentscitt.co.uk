				<h4>My Background</h4>
				<p>I have always worked within the childcare profession. I started working in pre-schools and went on to work for a government scheme, supporting children with SEND in mainstream schools. I studied a foundation degree in Early Years Education, met my husband and moved to Cyprus. There, I worked in an international school teaching Reception year and had two children of my own. I moved back to England and got a job as an LSA in an infant school. When my youngest started school, I did a top up to my foundation degree to gain a BA honours in Childhood Studies, with the intention of doing my teacher training.</p>

				<h4>Why I wanted to teach</h4>
				<p>I had always thought about teaching, but initially, I didn’t have the confidence to do a degree. When I worked in a school in Cyprus, I knew that school was where I belonged! When I returned to England, I wanted to gain experience as an LSA, and doing this confirmed that teaching was the job for me! I waited until my own children were settled at school before I went back to university and on to do teacher training.</p>

				<h4>Training</h4>
				<p>I looked at all the different routes into teaching, but I felt excited about the SCITT route because it was hands on experience from the start. The training started at the end of August and it eased us in with a week’s induction, with lots of opportunities to get to know all the other students and settle in. I have a school mentor and a SCITT mentor who are both extremely supportive. Choosing the Solent SCITT route into teaching was absolutely the best decision for me.</p>

				<h4>Future aspirations</h4>
				<p>I am so excited to get my own class and I feel confident that I am leaving the course as a great teacher. I have gained so much confidence in my teaching ability throughout the course and now I can’t wait to get started.</p>
