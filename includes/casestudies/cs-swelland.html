				<h4>My Background</h4>
				<p>I have a degree in Contemporary Dance from Chichester University. I graduated and moved to London to pursue a career in dance, however, I found that I wanted more from life than standing in a queue waiting to audition every day. So, I came back home and saw an advert for a learning support assistant at a local SEN provision. I had some experience from my dance background teaching children with SEN but didn't think they would choose me for the role. Much to my surprise, I got the job and loved every single moment of it during my four years there. I loved it so much and wanted to give back to the community that had taught me so much, so I investigated teacher training and ended up here at The Solent SCITT.</p>

				<h4>Why I wanted to teach</h4>
				<p>I have taught dance to many young people for years now and always found it therapeutic, but after experiencing the world through an SEN lens, I knew that teaching was exactly what I was meant to be doing and should have been doing a long time ago. I want to be able to inspire and motivate young people, I want them to always see that there is someone fighting their corner, for them to be the best version of themselves they can be because that is what they have taught me!</p>

				<h4>Training</h4>
				<p>Training at The SCITT has been a breath of fresh air. I have met many other like-minded people who share the same passion for teaching as I do. I have met lots of professionals who are currently working in education who have provided some priceless guidance and information that has helped me through my training journey. I have never been surer of wanting to teach and that is through the support and help of all the team at The Solent SCITT and the cohort I have been lucky enough to share the training with.</p>

				<h4>Future aspirations</h4>
				<p>I would like to become a headteacher one day but in the short term I want to be able to be the best teaching practitioner I can be and give something back to all the wonderful children who inspired me to start this journey.</p>
