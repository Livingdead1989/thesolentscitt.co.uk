	        <h4>My Background</h4>
	        <p>I studied Art when I first went to University of Tallinn in Estonia with a view of becoming an art teacher. As life followed its own trajectory at the time, I moved to UK. Within a few years, I became a mum to two precious boys. I put all my career aspirations aside but as the boys grew, I began looking into becoming a teacher again. I started an Open University course (Sports Psychology route) alongside working in a local secondary school to gain school experience whilst studying. I enjoyed the school environment so much! The buzz of the playground, the corridors and witnessing pupils and staff generating amazing pieces of work was awe-inspiring. So, once the last few months of study were underway, I applied for the primary teacher training course with The Solent SCITT.</p>

	        <h4>Why I wanted to teach</h4>
	        <p>Teaching was always my chosen career route throughout childhood. I was very lucky to have superb teachers when growing up – the type that would never give up on you, and never let you underachieve. Now it is my turn to do the same. I would like to support children in finding their feet in this big world and improve their chances of fulfilling that enormous potential that all of them possess.</p>

	        <h4>Training</h4>
	        <p>There were a few reasons I chose The Solent SCITT as my Initial Teacher Training provider. I was lucky enough to be able to choose from three, however The Solent SCITT stood out for me from the moment I got invited to the interview. From the smooth communication with both SCITT staff and tutors, to the high standard lecture and workshop days to the SCITT’s special attention to the trainee’s wellbeing, and well-matched placement schools, The Solent SCITT has definitely been the right choice for me.</p>

	        <h4>Future aspirations</h4>
	        <p>The Solent SCITT offers PGCE degree through Portsmouth University, likewise, it also awards me with points towards my future master’s degree. Once I have successfully established myself as a confident practitioner, I will embark on my master’s degree journey and hopefully continue my career from there. But for now, I am looking forward to having my own classroom and sharing all the fun facts I have in my head with the children. I can’t wait!</p>
