				<h4>My Background</h4>
				<p>I have an undergraduate degree in International Wildlife Biology and a master’s degree in Global Wildlife Health and Conservation. I have previously worked as an ecological surveyor, surveying for invasive species in and around London. As part of this role I worked closely with members of the public, educating them on the species being surveyed – this was my favourite part of the job. It broke up the days and I loved encouraging the curiosity of young people and answering all the weird and wonderful questions the children came up with! This is when I started thinking about teaching.</p>

				<h4>Why I wanted to teach</h4>
				<p>Before I started teacher training, I worked for a large retail outlet. The job kept me busy, but I didn’t feel passionate about what I was doing or have any sense of accomplishment at the end of the day. I wanted a job which I knew, with confidence, was having some form of positive impact. In teaching you can see the positive contributions you’re making to children’s lives in real time. I knew that choosing this career would mean that no matter how hard the day, I could always leave work knowing that what I had done that day was worthwhile.</p>

				<h4>Training</h4>
				<p>I am a very academically minded person, so before any interviews for teacher training, I was convinced I would be choosing a university-led course. But my interview at The Solent SCITT completely changed my mind. My interview process was friendly, welcoming and above all my mind at ease that I would always get the support I would need when completing the course. This has been proven over and over again since September, with my mentor routinely checking to ensure I am ok and always willing to provide help, from lesson planning to taking the time on her days off to provide guidance with important decisions such as accepting a job offer for my NQT year. Everyone on the team goes out of their way to ensure that training is as smooth as it can be, and trainee welfare is always a priority.</p>

				<h4>Future aspirations</h4>
				<p>At the moment, my future aspirations are simply to be the best teacher I can be. I know I still have a lot learn, so I plan to focus on enhancing my teaching practice and ensuring that I am helping the students in the best way I possibly can over the coming years.</p>
