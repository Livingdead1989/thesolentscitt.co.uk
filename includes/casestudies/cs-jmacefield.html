				<h4>My Background</h4>
				<p>Having had an ardent curiosity for the natural world and our human relationships with it for as long as I have been capable of pondering such a concept, it would seem reasonable that I should always have considered teaching geography. The days of my youth were largely spent exploring the countryside – collecting fossils, photographing intriguing landscapes and combing beaches and fields for interesting rocks that might offer some insight into our Earth’s past.</p>

				<h4>Why I wanted to teach</h4>
				<p>After having been told by my friends and family that I would be suited to teaching and should consider it as a career pathway, I realised that the prospect of being able to help shape and support young minds is extraordinarily exciting. I have had some particularly adept and inspiring teachers myself, which has furthered my desire to ignite a flame of interest in others. What better time to spark a passion for our world, than at such a crucial hour for the relationship between people and the natural environment?</p>

				<h4>Training</h4>
				<p>My experience with The Solent SCITT has been terrific. I have loved having the opportunity to be in a proper school environment from the beginning of the course, and this exposure has allowed me to rapidly develop my teaching skills and confidence. The training programme which has accompanied my school experience has helped me progress my teaching strategies and my understanding of pedagogy too. I have been provided with excellent levels of support throughout and have been made to feel welcome from day one. I am incredibly grateful to The Solent SCITT and would recommend them to anybody.</p>

				<h4>Future aspirations</h4>
				<p>Despite only being in the early stages of my teaching career, I aspire to one day progress to a more senior role whereby I can take on more advanced responsibilities and help to support future trainees and newly/recently qualified teachers. I would also love the opportunity to run an extracurricular club… perhaps one focused on Geology or Environmental Studies!</p>
