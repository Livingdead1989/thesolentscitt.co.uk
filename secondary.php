        <p>At The Solent SCITT, we believe every single pupil deserves to be taught by an excellent specialist teacher who will ignite their love of learning and inspire them to continue this learning beyond the school gates.</p>
        <p><a href="/assets/full_programme.pdf" target="_blank">The Solent SCITT full programme</a> is an innovative school-led Initial Teacher Training model. Over the course of one intensive year we will give you the skills and experience required to become a highly effective, fully qualified teacher, able to take up a teaching post anywhere in the UK or, with an optional PGCE qualification, anywhere in the world.</p>
