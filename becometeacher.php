        <h2>Why become a Teacher?</h2>
        <p>The top reasons for choosing a career in teaching</p>

        <h4>Teachers are in Demand</h4>
        <p>Latest data shows that 9 out of 10 new teachers who want to teach found teaching jobs in the first 12 months. 95% of primary trained NQTs and 94% of secondary trained respondents were in employment in first 12 months.</p>

        <h4>Starting Salary of between £22k and £27k</h4>
        <p>The average starting salary for teachers in England now stands at £24,200 [Source: School Workforce Census, November 2013]. This compares favourably with average starting salaries of UK graduates who are employed six months after graduation (£18,345 – £22,535)<br><em>[Source: What Do Graduates Do? 2013, HECSU/AGCAS/UCAS]</em>.</p>

        <h4>Teachers can earn up to £65,000 as a Leading Practitioner</h4>
        <p>The leading practitioner pay range from 1 September 2014 applies to qualified teachers who are employed in posts that the relevant body has determined have the primary purpose of modelling and leading improvement of teaching skills.</p>

        <h4>Up to £25,000 Tax-Free to Train</h4>
        <p>Bursaries are available for trainees on eligible postgraduate courses in England. Bursary amounts will vary depending on teaching subject and degree class or highest relevant academic qualification.</p>

        <h4>Teacher Training is better than ever</h4>
        <p>92% of newly qualified secondary teachers, and 90% of newly qualified primary teachers highly rated the overall quality of their training.</p>

        <h4>Change a Young Person’s Life</h4>
        <p>Teachers make students curious, question, and criticise. Teachers make the frightened, confident. The uninterested, ambitious. And the gifted… brilliant</p>

        <h4>Career for Achievers</h4>
        <p>Three-quarters of new teachers now have a 1st or 2:1 degree – the highest proportion ever recorded.</p>
