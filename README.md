**End of Life**

# thesolentscitt.co.uk

The Solent SCITT was a teacher training organisation based within Park Community School. I created a Foundation 6 framework website that was hosted on-site by myself, which enabled Solent SCITT to develop their online presence.

## End of the Road

The Solent SCITT has now merged with a parent company and as a result the website is no longer required. Its been a great experience working with this site and their lead content provider.
