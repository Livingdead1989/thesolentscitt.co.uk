          <h2>Biology</h2>
          <p class="lead">Why Biology?</p>
          <p>Biology is the study of life at a number of levels, from cells to how organisms can function.
          <br>Organ systems working together is complex, yet magnificently allows animals to survive many threats, such as mutations and microbial attacks. The study of such systems is fascinating. In humans, the immune system fighting off infection to the circulatory system providing key nutrients to the cells of the body to the nervous system communicating enabling reflex reactions for survival are all important aspects of biological study.</p>
          <p>In plants, the leaves full of chloroplasts enabling water and carbon dioxide using light energy to form glucose is an awe inspiring process. The clever transport system allowing glucose and water to be moved efficiently through the plant helps our understanding of how plants function effectively.
          <br>Together, the study of life can open an interest and passion within pupils that could spark the hunger to achieve the next Biological milestone.
          <br>At the heart of Biology is the excitement of new information and discoveries as a result of new and inspired minds, wanting to follow in the footsteps of Pasteur, Jenner and Darwin. All ahead of their time, could you inspire a new generation of biologists?</p>

Successful candidates will be assigned to a partnership school which will serve as the main training school. All trainees will teach across Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 and experience teaching in a second contrasting school within the partnership. This second school experience takes place in the Spring Term and is approximately six weeks long.</p>
          <p>Your school based mentor has responsibility for ensuring that you have an appropriate Individual Training Plan (ITP) and that you have every opportunity to meet the Professional Standards for Qualified Teacher Status.
