        <h2>About the SCITT</h2>
        <p>Now in its 4th year the Solent SCITT based at Park Community School is enjoying its most diverse class of trainee teachers yet.</p>
        <p>Ranging in age from 25 to 54 the student teachers have one thing in common – a desire to teach and inspire the next generation. <br>For some this has meant a continuation from a degree and for others a complete change of career.</p>
        <p>In the case of Walter Cole, who has moved across the globe from Sydney, the course so far has been <em>“excellent beyond expectation”</em>.</p>
