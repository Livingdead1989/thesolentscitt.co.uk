        <h2>About The Solent SCITT</h2>
        <p>Now in its 8th year, The Solent SCITT based at Park Community School has had its best recruitment cycle to date.</p>
        <p>Ranging in age and experience, the student teachers have one thing in common – a desire to teach and inspire the next generation.</p> 
        <p>For some this has meant a continuation from a degree and for others a complete change of career.</p>
        <p>David Lown enjoyed a distinguished career in Bio Medical Science before deciding to train to become a Biology teacher in 2018/19 and found the ‘hands on’ nature of the course hugely beneficial:</p> 
        <p>"Being able to undertake teacher training with the Solent SCITT offers a unique and safe environment to learn on the job.</p>
        <p>“With students from a plethora of backgrounds, the Solent SCITT provides the ideal opportunity to train in different school placements, with taught aspects of the course provided in small, close-knit groups."</p>
